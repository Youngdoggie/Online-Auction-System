1. Make Lot to be an abstract class and reserveLot regularLot and dualminLot extends from that.
2. Open/Close Principle: Add additional functionality to auction class that shows information of the Lots in auction like what type is the lot.
3. Interface Segregation Principle: Make an interface for Lot.
4. Dependency Inversion Principle: In auction class we are creating regular lots based on begining lot number and ending lot number. In the other word that auction
class is depend on regular Lot which against DIP rules. What we do to fix this is to make a Lot as an interface.
